# Binary Search Tree for iPhones

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage a dataset of iPhones, categorized by model, color, and storage.

## Features
- Insert, search, and remove iPhone entities in the BST.
- Display all iPhones in sorted order.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o bst`).
3. Run the executable (`./bst`).

## Limitations
- Does not handle duplicate iPhone entries.
- Assumes unique combinations of model, color, and storage.
